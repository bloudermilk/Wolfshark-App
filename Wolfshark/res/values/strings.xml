	    \nThis app is dedicated to helping you get around campus easier than ever before. To begin simply choose your beginning and ending destinations, then press \"GO!\" The subsequent screen will give you three route options optimized to get you to your destination the quickest and easiest.\n
	    \n
	    To zoom in on your destination just tap on the marker- a screen showing you the precise location of your destination will appear. You can also save favorites so you never have to worry about finding that crumpled up post it note you wrote your schedule on again.\n
	    \n
	    If you want to save your classes ahead of time, use the My Places screen. To edit your Places, open up the menu and press \"Edit Places\". This will take you to a screen where you can choose from all the locations on campus.\n\n
